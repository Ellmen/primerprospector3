    """ Hold paths for proper handling
        Paths in this sense are filenames, directory paths, or filepaths. 
        Some examples include:
         file.txt
         ./path/to/file.txt
         ./path/to/dir/
         /path/to/file.txt
         .
         /
        The purpose of this class is to allow all paths to be handled the
         same since they sometimes need to be treated differently than 
         simple strings. For example, if a path has a space in it, and it
         is being passed to system, it needs to be wrapped in quotes. But,
         you wouldn't want it as a string wrapped in quotes b/c, e.g.,
         isabs('"/absolute/path"') == False, b/c the first char is a ", not
         a /.
        * This would make more sense to call Path, but that conflicts with
            the ResultPath.Path attribute. I'm not sure what to do about this
            and want to see what others think. Once finalized, a global
            replace should take care of making the switch.
